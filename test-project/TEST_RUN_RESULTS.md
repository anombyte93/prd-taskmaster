## Test 2: Full PRD Generation Simulation

### Step 0: Enable Plan Mode + Check for Incomplete Work

```
USER: I want a PRD for adding a dark mode toggle to my web app

CLAUDE:
I'll help you create a comprehensive PRD for dark mode toggle feature.

üîß Enabling plan mode for interactive prompts...
‚úÖ Plan mode enabled

üîç Checking for incomplete work from previous session...
‚úÖ No incomplete work found - starting fresh
```

---

### Step 1: Detect Taskmaster

```
CLAUDE:
Let me check for taskmaster integration...

Checking for MCP Task-Master-AI...
[Attempts: mcp__task-master-ai__get_tasks]

Result: MCP detected ‚úÖ
TASKMASTER_METHOD="MCP"

Great! I'll use MCP for seamless taskmaster integration.
```

**If taskmaster NOT found:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Taskmaster Required

This skill REQUIRES taskmaster (MCP or CLI) to function.

I didn't detect taskmaster. Please install:

Option 1 (RECOMMENDED): Install MCP Task-Master-AI
  ‚Ä¢ Add to Claude Code MCP settings
  ‚Ä¢ See: https://github.com/cyanheads/task-master-ai

Option 2: Install CLI
  ‚Ä¢ npm install -g task-master-ai

Type 'done' when installed.

[BLOCKS HERE - won't proceed without taskmaster]
```

---

### Step 2: Discovery Questions

```
CLAUDE:
Let me ask detailed questions to ensure a comprehensive PRD:

**1. What problem does this solve?**
Tell me about the user pain point and business impact.

USER:
Users complain about eye strain when using the app at night.
We're seeing 40% of our traffic happen after 8pm, but no dark mode.
Users are requesting it in support tickets (about 50 tickets/month).

CLAUDE:
**2. Who is the target user/audience?**

USER:
All web app users, particularly night-time users and developers who prefer dark interfaces.

CLAUDE:
**3. What tech stack are you using?**

USER:
React frontend, Tailwind CSS for styling, localStorage for preferences

CLAUDE:
**4. What are your key success metrics?**

USER:
- 60% of users enable dark mode within first month
- Reduce eye strain complaints by 80%
- Increase user engagement during evening hours by 15%

CLAUDE:
**5. Any constraints or timeline?**

USER:
Need to ship in 2 weeks. Must persist user preference across sessions.

CLAUDE:
**6. Anything else I should know?**

USER:
Should respect system preferences (prefers-color-scheme), but allow manual override.
Need to ensure accessibility (WCAG AA contrast ratios).

[... Claude processes all answers ...]

Perfect! I have everything I need.

# PRD: Dark Mode Toggle

## Executive Summary
Add dark mode toggle to reduce eye strain for 40% of users who access
the app after 8pm. Will reduce support tickets by 80% and increase
evening engagement by 15%.

## Problem Statement
### User Impact
- 40% of traffic occurs after 8pm
- Users report eye strain from bright UI at night
- 50 support tickets/month requesting dark mode
- Competitors have dark mode, we don't

### Business Impact
- User satisfaction suffering (NPS impact)
- Support team spending 10 hours/month on dark mode requests
- Risk of user churn to competitors with dark mode

## Goals & Success Metrics
1. **Adoption Goal**: 60% of users enable dark mode within 1 month
   - Metric: % users with dark_mode: true in localStorage
   - Baseline: 0%
   - Target: 60%
   - Timeframe: 30 days post-launch

2. **Support Reduction**: Reduce eye strain tickets by 80%
   - Metric: # support tickets mentioning "dark mode" or "eye strain"
   - Baseline: 50/month
   - Target: 10/month
   - Timeframe: 1 month post-launch

3. **Engagement Increase**: 15% more evening engagement
   - Metric: Session duration between 8pm-11pm
   - Baseline: Current average
   - Target: +15%
   - Timeframe: 2 months post-launch

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture
- React Context for theme state
- Custom useTheme() hook
- Tailwind dark: variant for styling

### Implementation Details

```typescript
// Context
const ThemeContext = createContext();

// Hook
function useTheme() {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState(() => {
    // Check localStorage
    const saved = localStorage.getItem('theme');
    if (saved) return saved;

    // Check system preference
    if (window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches) {
      return 'dark';
    }

    return 'light';
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    localStorage.setItem('theme', theme);
    document.documentElement.classList.toggle('dark', theme === 'dark');
  }, [theme]);

  return { theme, setTheme };
}
```

### Tailwind Configuration
```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  darkMode: 'class',
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        dark: {
          bg: '#1a1a1a',
          surface: '#2d2d2d',
          text: '#e0e0e0',
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Testing Strategy
