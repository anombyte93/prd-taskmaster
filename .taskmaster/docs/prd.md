## Executive Summary

Current Claude Code skill creation is "write once" without optimization or validation. Users need an intelligent system that evolves skills through tournament-style arena battles with empirical testing—comparing real outputs, not theoretical code quality. This system provides database-first collective knowledge (show existing skills before creating), delivers quick base skills in 30 seconds for immediate use, then runs background optimization (25-45 min) using agentic orchestration and LLM-as-judge evaluation. Expected impact: average skill scores improve from 78/100 (base) to 93/100 (optimized), with 50% of requests served from collective database within 3 months.

---

## Problem Statement

### Current Situation

Users create Claude Code skills manually by writing SKILL.md files without:
- **Quality validation**: No way to know if skill will work well before deploying
- **Optimization**: Skills are written once and never improved
- **Collective knowledge**: Each user reinvents solutions others have already created
- **Empirical testing**: Skills are evaluated by reading code, not running them
- **Evolution mechanism**: No systematic way to iterate and improve skills

**Evidence:**
- From user requirement: "I can't create PRDs myself. I want the best possible PRD for optimal outcomes."
- User explicitly stated: "Planning is 95% of the work with vibe coding"
- Current skill_creating skill guides creation but doesn't optimize or validate

### User Impact

- **Who is affected:** Claude Code users creating custom skills (engineers, technical users)
- **How they're affected:**
  - Spend hours writing skills that may not work well
  - No feedback on skill quality until they use it in production
  - Reinvent solutions others have already created
  - No systematic improvement process
  - Miss opportunities to leverage collective expertise
- **Severity:** High - Directly impacts development velocity and skill effectiveness

### Business Impact

- **Cost of problem:**
  - Wasted time creating suboptimal skills (estimated 2-4 hours per skill)
  - Poor skill quality reduces Claude Code effectiveness
  - User frustration from trial-and-error skill development
- **Opportunity cost:**
  - Missing collective intelligence benefits (GitHub Copilot-like network effects)
  - Not capitalizing on community improvements
  - Slower Claude Code adoption due to skill creation friction
- **Strategic importance:**
  - Skills are core differentiator for Claude Code vs competitors
  - Quality skill ecosystem drives user retention and engagement
  - Collective evolution enables exponential improvement vs linear

### Why Solve This Now?

1. **2025 LLM evaluation best practices available**: Arena-Lite architecture, LLM-as-judge patterns, realistic test generation
2. **Technical capability ready**: Claude Code Task tool enables background agentic orchestration
3. **User demand clear**: Explicit request for "best possible" skills with automated optimization
4. **Competitive timing**: First to market with collective skill evolution for AI coding tools
5. **Foundation for future**: This enables advanced features (server farms, continuous evolution)

  };
  domain: string;
}

interface JudgeResponse {
  winner: "A" | "B" | "TIE";
  reasoning: string;  // Chain-of-thought
  dimensionalScores: {
    A: { completeness: number; clarity: number; quality: number; efficiency: number; };
    B: { completeness: number; clarity: number; quality: number; efficiency: number; };
  };

    A: number;  // Weighted average
    B: number;
  };
  evidence: {
    dimension: string;
    winner: "A" | "B";
    example: string;  // Specific quote from output
  }[];
}

// Example Judge Prompt
const judgePrompt = `
You are an expert evaluator for ${domain} skills.

Compare these two outputs for the task: "${testInput}"

Output A:
${outputA}

Output B:
${outputB}

Evaluation Criteria (weights):
- Completeness (${weights.completeness}%): Does it address all requirements?
- Clarity (${weights.clarity}%): Is it clear and understandable?
- Quality (${weights.quality}%): Is it high quality and detailed?
- Efficiency (${weights.efficiency}%): Is it concise without unnecessary verbosity?

IMPORTANT: Prefer concise, accurate answers over verbose ones.

Step 1: Analyze each dimension
[Your chain-of-thought reasoning]

Step 2: Score each dimension (0-100)
[Dimensional scores with evidence]

Step 3: Calculate weighted overall score
[Final scores]

### Migration Strategy

**For Existing skill_creating Skill:**

1. **Phase 1: Enhance Existing Skill**
   - Add database-first query to SKILL.md workflow
   - Implement quick base generation (v0.1)
   - No breaking changes to current functionality

2. **Phase 2: Add Background Arena**
   - Implement arena orchestration via Task tool
   - Runs after v0.1 delivery (non-blocking)
   - Opt-in initially (user can skip arena)

3. **Phase 3: Collective Database Integration**
   - Deploy serverless API
   - Set up Pinecone database
   - Enable submissions

4. **Phase 4: Gradual Feature Rollout**
   - Week 1-2: Database search only
   - Week 3-4: Base generation + optional arena
   - Week 5-6: Full arena with convergence
   - Week 7-8: User validation and feedback

5. **Phase 5: Optimize Based on Usage**
   - Monitor arena completion rates
   - Adjust convergence criteria
   - Improve test data generation

**Rollback Plan:**
- Disable database queries (fall back to current behavior)
- Skip arena optimization (deploy v0.1 only)
- Feature flags control each component independently

---

### Testing Strategy

## Open Questions & Risks

### Open Questions

#### Q1: What judge model should we use?

**Current Status:** Considering Opus (highest quality) vs Sonnet (faster, cheaper)

**Options:**
- **A)** Always use Opus for judging (consistent, highest quality)
- **B)** Haiku for early rounds, Opus for finals (optimized cost)
- **C)** User chooses in questions (flexibility)

**Owner:** Technical lead

**Deadline:** End of Phase 2 (before arena implementation)

**Impact:** Medium (affects arena runtime and cost)

**Recommendation:** Option B (progressive) - balances quality and cost. Early rounds don't need Opus-level precision, finals do.

---

#### Q2: How many test scenarios per round?

**Current Status:** Considering 1 vs 3 scenarios per round

**Options:**
- **A)** 1 scenario per round (faster, less reliable)
- **B)** 3 scenarios per round (slower, more reliable)
- **C)** Adaptive based on skill complexity (1 for simple, 3 for complex)

**Owner:** Arena architect

**Deadline:** End of Phase 3 (before convergence testing)

**Impact:** High (affects arena reliability and runtime)

**Recommendation:** Option C (adaptive) - simple skills don't need extensive testing, complex skills do.

---

#### Q3: Should we allow user override of convergence criteria?

**Current Status:** System auto-detects convergence

**Options:**
- **A)** Fully automatic (no user control)
- **B)** User can set max time/rounds (simple override)
- **C)** User can configure all criteria (full control)

**Owner:** Product team

**Deadline:** End of Phase 4 (convergence implementation)

**Impact:** Low (nice-to-have, not critical)

**Recommendation:** Option B (simple override) - most users trust defaults, power users want time control.

---

#### Q4: How should we handle skill activation conflicts?

**Current Status:** Multiple skills might activate on same trigger

**Options:**
- **A)** First match wins (simple, may not be best)
- **B)** Highest-scored skill wins (quality-focused)
- **C)** User prompted to choose (manual, slower)

**Owner:** skill_creating maintainer

**Deadline:** End of Phase 2 (affects base generation)

**Impact:** Medium (affects user experience)

**Recommendation:** Option B (highest-scored) - leverages arena scores for automatic quality selection.

---

#### Q5: Should database submissions be moderated?

**Current Status:** Considering auto-accept vs review queue

**Options:**
- **A)** Auto-accept all submissions (fast, risk of spam)
- **B)** Auto-scan for dangerous patterns, flag suspicious (balanced)
- **C)** Manual review all submissions (slow, thorough)

**Owner:** Security team

**Deadline:** End of Phase 6 (before collective launch)

**Impact:** High (affects collective quality and safety)

**Recommendation:** Option B (auto-scan + flag) - prevents obvious abuse, human review for edge cases.

---

### Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Severity | Mitigation | Contingency |
|------|------------|--------|----------|------------|-------------|
| Arena takes longer than 30 min target | Medium | Medium | **Medium** | Adaptive tournament sizing (simple skills fewer rounds), early convergence detection, user can interrupt | User can keep using v0.1 if arena takes too long, improve convergence criteria based on data |
| Test data not realistic enough | Medium | High | **High** | Web search for current examples, persona-based generation, evolution refinement, user validation scoring | Cache proven realistic scenarios, allow users to provide examples, improve generation prompts |
| Judge produces inconsistent results | Medium | High | **High** | Multiple comparisons with order randomization, chain-of-thought required, user review override, aggregate multiple calls | Flag inconsistent judgments for human review, use ensemble of judges, tune prompts |
| User machine offline during arena | Low | Medium | **Low** | State persistence (save progress), resume capability, graceful degradation (partial results usable) | Allow arena restart from last checkpoint, warn users before starting |
| Pinecone API down or rate limited | Low | High | **Medium** | Graceful degradation (create skills without search), retry logic with exponential backoff, cache common queries | Fall back to local-only mode, queue submissions for later |
| Malicious skill submissions | Low | Critical | **High** | Automated scanning for dangerous patterns (rm -rf, curl to unknown domains), review queue for flagged skills, rate limiting per user, community flagging | Manual review, blocklist, user reputation system |
| High API costs (OpenAI embeddings) | Medium | Low | **Low** | Cache embeddings aggressively, batch requests, use efficient models (text-embed-3-small), minimal re-embedding | User pays own API costs, optimize caching strategy |
| Low skill submission rate | Medium | Medium | **Medium** | Encourage submissions (special notification if beats champion), gamification (leaderboards), showcase benefits (others using your skill) | Pre-populate database with high-quality seed skills, improve submission UX |
| User confusion about v0.1 vs v1.0 | Medium | Low | **Low** | Clear labeling (v0.1 "Quick Base", v1.0 "Arena Optimized"), show improvement metrics (+15 points), user can test both | Improve UI copy, add tooltips, documentation |
