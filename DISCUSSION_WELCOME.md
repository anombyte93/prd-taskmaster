## 🙋 Maintainer Notes

**Status:** This is a beta release built with "vibe-coding" methodology. It works well for the creator's workflow but hasn't been extensively tested by others.

**What I'm looking for:**
- Real-world usage feedback
- Bug reports with context
- Ideas for new templates (API, mobile, ML/AI projects, etc.)
- Validation rule suggestions
- Examples of PRDs that worked well (or didn't)

**Response time:** I'll try to respond within 24-48 hours. This is a side project, so patience is appreciated!

**Philosophy:** Honest feedback > false praise. If something doesn't work or could be better, I want to know!
