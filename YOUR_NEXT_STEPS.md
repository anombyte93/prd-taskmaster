## 📋 Publishing Checklist

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository (5 minutes)

**Option A: Using GitHub CLI (Easiest)**

```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/prd-taskmaster
gh repo create prd-taskmaster --public --source=. --push --description "AI-powered PRD generation for Claude Code with taskmaster integration"
```

That's it! Your repo will be live at:
**https://github.com/anombyte93/prd-taskmaster**

**Option B: Using GitHub Website**

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Fill in:
   - Name: `prd-taskmaster`
   - Description: `AI-powered PRD generation for Claude Code with taskmaster integration`
   - Visibility: **Public** ✓
   - Don't initialize with README (you already have one)
3. Click "Create repository"
4. Then run:
   ```bash
   cd ~/.claude/skills/prd-taskmaster
   git remote add origin https://github.com/anombyte93/prd-taskmaster.git
   git push -u origin master
   ```

### Step 2: Add Topics on GitHub (2 minutes)

After repo is created:

1. Go to: https://github.com/anombyte93/prd-taskmaster
2. Click the ⚙️ icon next to "About"
3. Add these topics (paste one at a time):
   ```
   claude-code
   claude-skills
   prd
   product-requirements
   taskmaster
   ai-development
   requirements-engineering
   product-management
   ```
4. Click "Save changes"

This helps people discover your skill!

---

### Step 3: Test Fresh Install (5 minutes)

Make sure it works for new users:

```bash
# In a different directory
cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/anombyte93/prd-taskmaster.git
cd prd-taskmaster

# Verify files are there
ls -la

# Should see:
# - README.md (user-friendly version)
# - SKILL.md (main skill)
# - LICENSE
# - templates/
# - scripts/
# - reference/
```

If that works, you're good!

## 🚀 Sharing Your Skill

### Start Simple (Pick 1-2)

**Easiest:** Reddit + Twitter

1. **Reddit - r/ClaudeAI**
   - Open `SHARING_TEMPLATES.md`
   - Copy the "Reddit - r/ClaudeAI" template
   - Post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/submit
   - Choose "Text Post"
   - Paste template, click "Post"

2. **Twitter/X**
   - Open `SHARING_TEMPLATES.md`
   - Copy the "Twitter/X Single Post" template
   - Tweet it!
   - Tag @AnthropicAI if you want

**That's enough for v1.0!** Don't overwhelm yourself.

### If You Want More (Optional)

3. **Hacker News Show HN**
   - Go to: https://news.ycombinator.com/submit
   - Use template from `SHARING_TEMPLATES.md`
   - Best time: Tuesday-Wednesday 9-11am PST

4. **Dev.to Blog Post**
   - Use the blog template from `SHARING_TEMPLATES.md`
   - Post here: https://dev.to/new

5. **Product Hunt** (wait until you have some users first)

## 📊 What to Expect

**Realistic Expectations:**
- 5-10 people try it
- 2-3 pieces of feedback
- 1 person finds it genuinely useful
- Maybe 10-20 GitHub stars

**That's a successful v1.0 launch!**

Don't expect:
- Thousands of stars
- Viral success
- Immediate adoption

It's a niche tool for a specific workflow. That's okay!

## 💬 Handling Responses

### If Someone Reports a Bug

✅ **Good Response:**
> "Thanks for trying it! Can you share more details about what happened? I'll look into fixing this."

### If Someone Criticizes

✅ **Good Response:**
> "Appreciate the feedback! You're right about [specific point]. What would make it more useful for your workflow?"

### If Someone Loves It

✅ **Good Response:**
> "So glad it helped! What feature/template would you want next?"

### If Nobody Responds

✅ **Good Response to Yourself:**
> "That's okay! I built something useful for me, learned a lot, and shared it. Maybe it'll find its audience later."
