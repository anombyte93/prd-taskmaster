## Top 5 Features Summary

### 1. Real DateTime Tracking (B2)
**What:** Precise UTC timestamp tracking for all tasks/subtasks
**Why:** Get ACTUAL duration (not estimates), learn your pace
**How:** `python3 .taskmaster/scripts/track-time.py start|complete {task_id}`

### 2. Instant Rollback (A1)
**What:** Rollback to any task checkpoint anytime
**Why:** Undo work safely, try different approaches
**How:** User types "rollback to task X" during execution

### 3. Accuracy Learning (B3)
**What:** Analyzes estimated vs actual, adjusts future estimates
**Why:** Estimates get better over time based on YOUR pace
**How:** Auto-runs after every 10 tasks, suggests adjustments

### 4. Security Audit (D2)
**What:** Auto-generated security checklist from your code
**Why:** Don't miss security issues, systematic review
**How:** Runs before final USER-TEST checkpoint

### 5. Auto-Resume (A2)
**What:** Resumes exactly where Claude crashed
**Why:** Never lose work, pick up seamlessly
**How:** Detects on restart, offers resume options

---

## What's New in Workflow

### User Testing Checkpoints
- Every 5 tasks → USER-TEST checkpoint
- User manually tests functionality
- Types "passed" or "issues" to continue/fix
- Catches bugs early, prevents cascading errors

### 4 Execution Modes
1. **Sequential to Checkpoint** - One-by-one until USER-TEST
2. **Parallel to Checkpoint** - Independent tasks in parallel
3. **Full Autonomous** - ALL tasks, no stops
4. **Manual Control** - User decides everything

### Strict Git Policies
- Branch per task (`task-{id}-{slug}`)
- Sub-branch per subtask (`task-{id}-subtask-{n}`)
- Merge sub-branches → task branch
- Merge task branch → main
- Checkpoint tag after every task
- Clean history, easy rollback

### Progress Logging
- All work logged to `.taskmaster/docs/progress.md`
- Timestamp, duration, tests, issues, git status
- Real-time visibility into what's happening

---

## Testing Plan

### Ready to Test (Next Steps)

You asked for a real test with sample tasks. Here's what to do:

1. **Test with Small PRD (5 tasks)**
   ```
   Say: "I want a PRD for adding a simple contact form"
   Verify: Skill activates, detects taskmaster, generates PRD
   Check: 5 tasks + 1 USER-TEST checkpoint
   ```

2. **Test DateTime Tracking**
   ```
   Start a task
   Verify: Timestamps logged correctly
   Complete task
   Check: Duration calculated accurately
   ```

3. **Test Rollback**
   ```
   Complete 3 tasks
   Say: "rollback to task 2"
   Verify: Rolls back, creates backup branch
   ```

4. **Test Auto-Resume**
   ```
   Start task, kill Claude mid-execution
   Restart Claude
   Verify: Detects incomplete work, offers resume
   ```

5. **Test Accuracy Learning**
   ```
   Complete 10 tasks
   Verify: Accuracy report generated
   Check: Adjustment recommendations
   ```

## How to Test

**Start testing:**
```
claude

# Then say:
"I want a PRD for adding user authentication with OAuth"
```

**What to expect:**
1. Skill detects taskmaster (MCP or CLI)
2. Asks 12+ discovery questions
3. Generates comprehensive PRD
4. Inserts USER-TEST checkpoints
5. Presents 4 execution options
6. You type "1", "2", "3", or "4"
7. Autonomous execution begins!

## Questions?

Your choice on what's next:

1. **Test it now** - Show you a real PRD generation with all features
2. **Review first** - Walk through SKILL.md together
3. **Merge now** - Push feature branch to main
4. **Refine something** - Adjust any feature before testing

Type: 1, 2, 3, or 4
